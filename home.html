					Hi, welcome to my website. I'm not much of a UI/UX guy, but I tried my best. You can even hit the little toggle at the top right to switch to light mode if you want!
					Just know I will be frowning :(, dark mode is the only mode in my book. This website will contain a lot of information about myself. Each page is presented chronologically
					from most recent to least recent. There are overviews (like this) at the start of each page followed by a Table of Contents to let you jump to any topic. This page is the 
					general introduction. Take your time looking around the site, and if you have any questions my email is at the bottom of this page.

					My first introduction into the software world was taking an elective computer science course back in high school. Not knowing anything about the topic it was quite an experience
					learning about the subject area. After that there was no turning back. I went to Drexel because of their focus on the subject of computing and informatics. It was one
					of the only school that broke out an entire new college to be focused on the subject area. I hit the ground running at Drexel and made the most out of my time there. 
					Entering into the Honors Program, doing the accelerated Masters Program, and completing 2 minors some of my academic achievements during my time. 
					I have worked for 3 companies, each for 6 months, while at Drexel. I worked in software development at AGI helping with a scalable version of one of their softwares.
					At Unisys I worked as an MCP Security Developer. My main accomplishment there was adding in lockdown capability of Windows into their SaaS version of ClearPath in order
					to ensure the underlying Windows operating system won't interfere with the MCP service. My final coop was at Woodward McCoach, Inc. working as a software engineer. 
					There I worked with a small team to load firmware onto our custom boards over ethernet. My skill technical skill set has spanned many areas from low level bit twiddling to
					web and mobile app development. My main focus is expanding my knowledge base by both learning new things and digging deeper into the areas I know (or think I know). 
					I'm motivated and always put my all into everything that I do. I like getting things done, and getting them done right.
