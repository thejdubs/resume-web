				Hi, welcome to my website! I'm not much of a UI/UX guy, but I tried my best. You can hit the little toggle at the top right to switch to light mode if you want.
				Just know I will be frowning :(, dark mode is the only mode in my book. This website will contain a lot of information about myself. Each page is presented chronologically
				from most recent to least recent. There are overviews (like this) at the start of each page followed by a Table of Contents to let you jump to any topic. This page is the 
				general introduction. Take your time looking around the site, and if you have any questions my email is at the bottom of this page.
